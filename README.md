# Quick Note Extension

This allows the user to take fast and ephemeral notes from within the browser.
It isn't intended to be a large and persistent application, this is for quick
items to reference for a short period.

## How to build

To generate an extension, simply run the build script
```
./build.sh
```

This will generate a web-ext-artifacts folder, where the zip can then be
utilized as a plugin.
